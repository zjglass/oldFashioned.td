As the repository name implies, this will be an old fashioned, flash game era, grid style, wall and tower building defence game. 

This will be my (zjglass) first foray into pygame, so it will also be a learning experience.

I fully intend to eventually upload this to the Google Play store, and lightly monetize it with unobtrusive ads.

I am simultaneously looking into Kivy, so this project may eventually be ported to Kivy, if I can't find a reliable way to integrate Google Admob into a "Pygame Subset for Android" app.
